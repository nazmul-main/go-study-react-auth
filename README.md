To the right of the navigation bar, you'll find a "Sign In / Log In" button, which allows users to access their accounts.

## Home Page - Our Event Section

On the home page, we have a dedicated section where we showcase our educational events and services. Each service is presented with the following details:

- Relevant image
- Service name
- Price (if applicable)
- Short description

For each service, there's a "Learn More" button. Clicking this button will take you to the detailed information page for that service.

## Service Detail Page

We've created a service detail page for each service, providing comprehensive information, including:

- Full description
- Duration
- Instructor information
- Reviews and ratings

These details are tailored to each specific service, ensuring that you have all the information you need to make informed decisions.

## Private Routes

Our website implements two private routes:

1. **Sign-In**: Users can access certain features and pages only when signed in. This ensures a personalized experience and access to restricted content.

2. **Sign-Out**: We provide a convenient sign-out button that allows users to securely log out of their accounts when needed.

User authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place to control access to these private routes, enhancing security and user experience.

## Sign-In and Sign-Out Functionality

We've designed a robust user authentication system that allows users to:

- Sign in with their email and password.
- Validate their credentials to ensure security.
- Sign out of their accounts with a simple click of the "Log Out" button.
